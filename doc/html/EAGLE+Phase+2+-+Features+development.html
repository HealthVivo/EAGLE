<p>This EAGLE sub-project will address the development of features requested by users for the EAGLE Simulator, as long as they don't fit into more targeted sub-projects (Simulating reality, Analysis framework or BaseSpace).</p>

<p>We expect those features not to require a grand analysis of reqs/specs cycle, or we will consider moving them into their own sub-project.</p>

<p>Those features and their development status is very likely to be tracked completely by JIRA and not reported here, but this page will be useful as a bootstrap stage anyway.</p>

<h1 id="EAGLEPhase2-Featuresdevelopment-Requestedfeatures">Requested features</h1>

<ol>
	<li>User-specified random seeds</li>
	<li>Parsing of VCF Genotype (GT) field</li>
</ol>
