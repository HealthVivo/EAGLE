which variants really were in the original sample?)</li><li>Generating random datasets that are representative of real datasets to have life-like situations, but with the added benefits of knowing what the truth is: what the initial errors and mismatches are.</li><li>Simulating specific variants to figure out if/where/why they (don't) get detected - the provided variants can be random (usually for SNP and small indels) or accurate (usually by providing known translocations)</li><li>Pinpointing suspected deficiencies in tools in order to address them precisely</li><li>Generating datasets with controlled features to analyse specific situations without uncontrolled influence from other parameters</li><li>Generating reproducible datasets on separate servers</li></ul><h2 id="EAGLE-EnhancedArtificialGenomeEngine-HowEAGLEmaybeabletohelpyou">How EAGLE may be able to help you</h2><h3 id="EAGLE-EnhancedArtificialGenomeEngine-EAGLESimulation">EAGLE Simulation</h3><p>First, EAGLE can simulate a sample and its sequencing:</p><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="60%" src="attachments/1708520/1638795.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/1708520/1638795.jpg"></p><h3 id="EAGLE-EnhancedArtificialGenomeEngine-EAGLEAnalysis">EAGLE Analysis</h3><p>The output of EAGLE Simulation can then be used to validate or benchmark external tools such as Aligners and Variant Callers:<br /> <img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="60%" src="attachments/1708520/1638796.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/1708520/1638796.jpg"></p><p>...or Cancer Subtraction tools:<br /> <img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="50%" src="attachments/1708520/1638797.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/1708520/1638797.jpg"></p><h1 id="EAGLE-EnhancedArtificialGenomeEngine-UsingEAGLE">Using EAGLE</h1><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-right" width="20%" src="attachments/1708520/1638820.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/1708520/1638820.jpg"></p><p>To use EAGLE, you can either use a pre-installed version or configure and install one directly from the source repository. <a href="EAGLE%2B-%2BInstallation%2Band%2Bconfiguration%2Binstructions.html">Here</a> is how to do this.</p><p>For a step-by-step tutorial, you can go through the following examples in order, or jump to any of them directly.</p><ol><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BSimulating%2Ba%2Bsmall%2BRun%2BFolder%2Bfrom%2BPhiX.html">EAGLE Use Case - Simulating a small Run Folder from PhiX</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BSimulating%2Ba%2Btypical%2BHiSeq%2Brun%2Bfrom%2Ba%2BHuman%2Bsample%2B%2528haploid%2Bversion%2529.html">EAGLE Use Case - Simulating a typical HiSeq run from a Human sample (haploid version)</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BRefining%2Bour%2BHuman%2Bsequencing%2Bsimulation%2B%2528diploid%2Bversion%2529.html">EAGLE Use Case - Refining our Human sequencing simulation (diploid version)</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2B2x250%2Brealistic%2BHuman%2Bsequencing%2Bsimulation.html">EAGLE Use Case - 2x250 realistic Human sequencing simulation</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BSimulating%2Ba%2Buniform%2Breads%2Bdistribution%2Bin%2Bour%2BPhiX%2Bsimulation.html">EAGLE Use Case - Simulating a uniform reads distribution in our PhiX simulation</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BSimulating%2Btumour%252Bnormal%2Bpairs.html">EAGLE Use Case - Simulating tumour+normal pairs</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BSimulating%2Bpurity.html">EAGLE Use Case - Simulating purity</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BSimulating%2BCopy%2BNumber%2BVariations.html">EAGLE Use Case - Simulating Copy Number Variations</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BGenerating%2BBAM%2Bfiles%2Bfor%2Bvisualisation%2Bwith%2BIGV.html">EAGLE Use Case - Generating BAM files for visualisation with IGV</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BLong%2Breads%2Bsimulation.html">EAGLE Use Case - Long reads simulation</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BUsing%2Ba%2Bdifferent%2Btemplate%2Blength%2Bdistribution.html">EAGLE Use Case - Using a different template length distribution</a></li><li><a href="EAGLE%2BUse%2BCase%2B-%2BCoverage%2Baffected%2Bby%2BGC%2Bcontent.html">EAGLE Use Case - Coverage affected by GC content</a></li>
